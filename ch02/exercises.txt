#1b

Possible valid behaviors of `last :: [a] -> a` are returning any single element
of the list. The function cannot return more than one element (because the 
return type is not a list) and cannot return something not in the list (because
it must return something with the same type as the list elements, without
"knowing" what the real type is.)
